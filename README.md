A structured, hands-on learning repository for mastering Python fundamentals and the core data science stack — purpose-built for **AIOps practitioners** who want to apply ML/AI techniques to IT operations, monitoring, anomaly detection, and automation workflows.

---

## 📌 Why This Repository?

AIOps demands more than just scripting knowledge. This repository bridges the gap between Python basics and production-ready data science skills, using real-world AIOps scenarios like:

- Log parsing and event correlation
- Time-series analysis of infrastructure metrics
- Anomaly detection in server and application data
- Automating operational insights with ML

Whether you're an SRE, DevOps engineer, or platform engineer stepping into AI/ML — this is your guided path.
